              "Escape from Tarkov" is a hardcore, realistic, first-person
              shooter game developed by Battlestate Games. It's set in the
              fictional Russian city of Tarkov, which has been isolated by
              conflict and is now a warzone. The game focuses on intense PvP
              (player versus player) encounters, PvE (player versus environment)
              elements, and a robust loot-based economy.

            <h3>Gameplay Overview:</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Combat and Realism:</b> Realism is a key feature, with detailed
              weapon mechanics, ballistics, and inventory management. Players
              must manage their health, hunger, and hydration, and injuries can
              have significant impacts on gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Raids:</b>
              Players engage in raids, entering different areas of Tarkov to
              complete objectives, gather loot, and face AI-controlled enemies
              as well as other players.

              <b>Loot and Economy:</b>
              Loot is a central aspect; players scavenge for weapons, gear, and
              resources during raids. The game's economy involves trading,
              buying, and selling items both within the game and via an online
              flea market.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Character Progression:</b>
              There's a skill-based progression system for characters, allowing
              players to improve skills in various areas such as combat, medical
              treatment, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Risk and Reward:</b>
              Players risk losing their collected loot if they die during a
              raid, making the stakes high and the gameplay intense.

            <p>
              <b>Customization:</b>
              Players can modify weapons extensively, adjusting attachments,
              optics, and more for personalized gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Map Variety:</b>
              Tarkov features multiple maps, each with its own challenges,
              environments, and opportunities for loot.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Escape Routes:</b>
              The ultimate goal is to escape Tarkov by finding extraction points
              within the raids.
