          <p>
            ES6 or ECMAScript6 or ECMAScript(2015) is a trademarked
            specification standardized by European Computer Manufacturers
            Association (ECMA). As JavaScript popularity was rising and it has
            to be run on most of the browsers there was a need for a single
            platform where all new JavaScript features could be standardized
            thus ECMAScript was formed. Apart from JavaScript, there are other
            well-known implementations of ECMAScript like JScript and
            ActionScript. It has been used for both frontend client-side
            rendering and the world wide web and server-side rendering in
            Node.js.
